# Lukas Ntimis - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Lukas! 👋
🎓 I hold a degree in Finance and Accounting and have recently completed a Data Analysis Bootcamp.

🔍 With a solid foundation in financial and accounting principles, I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in the dynamic field of data science. I am keen on using data to drive decision-making and uncover actionable insights, positioning myself as an entry-level data specialist.

📊 During my bootcamp, I developed a strong ability to work with complex datasets and honed my skills in identifying patterns and trends. I also gained practical experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be invaluable in my future projects.

🛠️ In my free time, I explore new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of solving complex challenges through data.
