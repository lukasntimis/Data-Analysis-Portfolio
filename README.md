# Lukas Ntimis - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Lukas! üëã

üéì I hold a degree in Finance and Accounting and have recently completed a Data Analysis Bootcamp.

üîç With a solid foundation in financial and accounting principles, I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in the dynamic field of data science. I am keen on using data to drive decision-making and uncover actionable insights, positioning myself as an entry-level data specialist.

üìä During my bootcamp, I developed a strong ability to work with complex datasets and honed my skills in identifying patterns and trends. I also gained practical experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be invaluable in my future projects.

üõ†Ô∏è In my free time, I explore new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of solving complex challenges through data.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Analyzing Video Game Industry Trends and Insights
**Code:**[`Analyzing Video Game Industry Trends and Insights`](https://github.com/lukasntimis/MyProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20Video%20Game%20Industry%20Trends%20and%20Insights%20%20(1).ipynb)

**Goal:** To explore and understand key trends and data points within the video game industry, providing insights that can inform future strategies and decisions.

**Description:** The project we will be using contains data on video game sales, including the game's name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, sales in North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world, and global sales.

**Skills:** , data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, poisson distribution

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Math

**Results:** Using Python fuction, we addressed several key questions about the video game industry. Our analysis included identifying the top-selling games, determining the most popular platforms and genres, examining how sales differ by region, and exploring the relationships between the year of release, publisher, and sales figures. Additionally, we utilized a Poisson distribution to model the sales data effectively


## Venicle Sales Analysis

**Code:**[`Venicle Sales Analysis']()

**Goal:** This project aims to understand trends in car sales, identify factors influencing sales, and predict future sales based on historical data.

**Description:** This dataset offers a detailed compilation of vehicle sales transactions, encompassing a variety of data points. Included are the year, make, model, trim, body type, transmission type, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), state of registration, condition rating, odometer reading, exterior and interior colors, seller information, Manheim Market Report (MMR) values, selling prices, and sale dates.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

**Results:** Utilizing Python for analysis, this project will elucidate the factors driving car sales and highlight significant trends across various vehicle attributes. Additionally, it will develop predictive models capable of forecasting future sales, thereby providing valuable insights for strategic planning in the automotive industry.
